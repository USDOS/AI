## Background  

HIT MAN was developed by the US Department of Special Projects and Unified Response Services (US-SPURS) Office of Research and Development (O R&D). It builds upon US-SPURS' Staff and it's Partner Organizaions deep experience in advanced AI assistants, cognitive systems and multi-domain automation and interoperability.

This new platform represents a major leap forward in terms of cross-system knowledge integration, autonomous planning and execution powered by self-iterative machine learning and simultaneous solution discoveribility and real-time data ingestion.

Over 120 person-years of development effort have gone into the HIT MAN program so far. The project utilizes a mix of on-premise high performance computing infrastructure as well as public cloud services for storage and scalable processing. 

## Capabilities

<h3>Conversational Interface</h3>

   HIT MAN supports natural language conversations - no need to learn specific syntax or commands. HIT MAN understands domain context to respond appropriately.

<h3>Cross-App Knowledge</h3>

   HIT MAN can access data across a user's Google Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Keep, Office 365 and more to create complete user context for optimal operation.

<h3>Dynamic Learning</h3>

   Every user interaction provides more data for HIT MAN's cutting-edge neural networks to learn from. It continuously gets smarter and the experience more personalized.

<h3>Intelligent Task Automation</h3>

   HIT MAN can formulate plans and take autonomous actions to complete tasks like scheduling meetings, compiling reports, filling out forms across apps based on user preferences. Automate mundane tasks to be more productive and efficient. 

<h3>Tailored Workflows</h3>

   Create custom workflows that allow HIT MAN to follow step-by-step instructions for desired results, with the flexibility to switch between processes depending on user commands. Enjoy easy and efficient multi-app automation. 

<h3>Flexible Accessibility</h3>

   HIT MAN is always available wherever you are, without the need for complicated hardware or software setup. Simply use voice control or a web browser to access HIT MAN from anywhere at any time.  Make it part of your daily workflow. 

<h3>Sub-Agent Architecture</h3>

   HIT MAN can spin up subordinate helper bots if needed to parallelize handling of sub-tasks, dramatically reducing task completion times.   It can also easily and autonomously assign those sub-tasks to the best qualified agents. 

<h3>Intelligent Automation</h3>

   HIT MAN's advanced algorithms are designed to anticipate user needs and automatically take steps to optimize performance. The agent is constantly learning, so it can quickly identify potential issues and provide personalized solutions in the most efficient way possible. Get the job done right - faster than ever before!

<h3>Secure & Reliable Platform</h3>

   HIT MAN is built on a secure and reliable platform, ensuring fast and dependable service, every time. Your data is encrypted and stored securely in multiple locations to guarantee ultimate security and privacy protection for your valuable information. Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your informaton is safe with HIT MANâ€™s trusted platform technology. 

<h3>Full Transparency</h3>

   Users have complete control over HIT MANâ€™s operations; they can view logs, track progress on each task and make adjustments as needed in real time. Every action taken is logged for future reference via a complete audit trail. It's data science you can trust! 

<h3>Secure Data Management</h3>
  
   HIT MAN uses state-of-the-art encryption methods to ensure your data is secure at all times, both while in transit and at rest within our system. We guarantee the privacy of all user data â€” yours is safe with us!  

<h3>Convenience & Efficiency</h3>  

   HIT MAN is incredibly easy to use â€” it can be set up in minutes, without any technical experience. Its powerful artificial intelligence algorithms can analyze tasks and automatically break them down into sub-tasks, dramatically reducing task completion times. It can also easily and autonomously assign those sub-tasks to the best qualified agents. That way, users can focus on more important matters while HIT MAN takes care of the mundane tasks for them.
