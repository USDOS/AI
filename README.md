## Background  

HIT MAN was developed by the US Department of Special Projects and Unified Response Services (US-SPURS) Office of Research and Development (O R&D). It builds upon US-SPURS' Staff and it's Partner Organizaions deep experience in advanced AI assistants, cognitive systems and multi-domain automation and interoperability.

This new platform represents a major leap forward in terms of cross-system knowledge integration, autonomous planning and execution powered by self-iterative machine learning and simultaneous solution discoveribility and real-time data ingestion.

Over 120 person-years of development effort have gone into the HIT MAN program so far. The project utilizes a mix of on-premise high performance computing infrastructure as well as public cloud services for storage and scalable processing. 

## Capabilities

<h3>Conversational Interface</h3>

   HIT MAN supports natural language conversations - no need to learn specific syntax or commands. HIT MAN understands domain context to respond appropriately.

<h3>Cross-App Knowledge</h3>

   HIT MAN can access data across a user's:
  - Google Drive
  - Gmail
  - Google Calendar
  - Google Keep
  - Office 365 Suite
  - Any cloud based storage
  - Locally Stored Data
  - and more...

to create complete user context for optimal operation.

<h3>Dynamic Learning</h3>

   Every user interaction provides more data for HIT MAN's cutting-edge neural networks to learn from. It continuously gets smarter and the experience more personalized.
